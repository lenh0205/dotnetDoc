## 7. Stack - Heap
* **`Stack`** use static allocation at compile time -> for data have fixed-size
* **`Heap`** use for dynamic allocation at runtime -> for data that we don't know size at compile time, depend on data size at runtime

## 13. What are value types and reference types?
* **`Value type`** - save data  directly into Stack
```
Enum, Struct, int, float, boolean,...
```
* **`Reference Type`** - save **pointer reference** in Stack, but value of variable are in Heap
```
Class, Object, Array, Indexer, Interface
```
