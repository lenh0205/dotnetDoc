# Introduce
* I am a .NET developer with three years of experience in web development. 
* While my primary focus is on backend technologies such as ASP.NET Core Web API, SQL Server, and Entity Framework, I also have a foundational understanding of frontend technologies like React and ASP.NET Core MVC.

* Throughout my career, I have worked in Agile development environments and have occasionally taken on full-stack development responsibilities to meet project requirements. I have contributed to building management systems for government projects, including a documentation management system.

* These diverse experiences have allowed me to adapt to different project complexities and collaborate effectively with cross-functional teams to deliver high-quality solutions

# Describe your favorite/last project ?
* My favorite project would be my last oneâ€”a Document Management System for a government organization
* The goal was to improve transparency and efficiency in interdepartmental communication and document management.

* What made this project particularly interesting for me was its technical complexity. 
* It required working with both .NET Core and .NET Framework modules, integrating server-side rendering and client-side rendering. I had the opportunity to explore various technologies and design patterns, such as:
- UnitOfWork pattern for better data management,
- FluentValidation to simplify validation logic,
- Automapper for seamless object mapping,
- React for the frontend, where we built a custom application,
- And extensive unit testing to ensure reliability.

* The project was developed by a team of five, following the Agile process, where we used Jira for tracking tasks and Confluence for documentation. 
* In this project, I contributed as a full-stack developer, handling both backend and frontend development.

* Overall, this project was a great learning experience and helped me sharpen my technical skills while working in a collaborative environment.

# most difficult issue that you have faced ?
* I think when I try to integrate the digital signature service as a desktop app to my website; this is my first time doing feature like this
* the problem is that the document is only instruct about how to integrate it to an ASP.NET Mvc project
* so there is fail HTTP communication between React app and ASP.NET Core Web API when I try to apply it to my project
* so what I do is initiate a simple ASP.NET Mvc project and apply the integration successfully
