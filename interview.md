# Introduce
* I am a .NET developer with three years of experience in web development. 
* While my primary focus is on backend technologies such as ASP.NET Core Web API, SQL Server, and Entity Framework, I also have a foundational understanding of frontend technologies like React and ASP.NET Core MVC.

* Throughout my career, I have worked in Agile development environments and have occasionally taken on full-stack development responsibilities to meet project requirements. I have contributed to building management systems for government projects, including a documentation management system.

* These diverse experiences have allowed me to adapt to different project complexities and collaborate effectively with cross-functional teams to deliver high-quality solutions
